<h3>I once loved a girl so much that I did everything for her.I lied to my parents to be able to meet her after school,I bought her chocolates,I fought with my classmates just because they cracked a small joke on her,I was so loyal to her,I gave her all my time,love and attention.I respected her like a father would respect his daughter,I loved her like a son loves his mother and I protected her like a boyfriend protects his girlfriend.After two months,she broke up with me because she as bored and wanted another man.I was really hurt and I still loved her so much.I cried and I suffered everyday because of her but I had to move on.First of all,I had to realise how this girl was.In reality,she was someone who loved for fun and had no sense of moral values whatsoever.I had to put this in my head,then once I did this,I could move on more easily.I said to myself:Is this the type of girl that I deserve?Is she the one worth it?Someone who does not love me back and makes me suffer like I'm a toy.I realised how much of a pain she was,then I proceeded with blocking her and deleting her number so that I may never talk with her.Finally,I continued working hard in school and with great efforts,I could move on.All of these things called love,it just takes place in your head.Once you get control over your head,you will be able to move on.It is just your head,take control of it and moving on shall be easy.If you have any doubts,please feel free to ask me in the form below</h3>

<h3>I once loved a girl so much that I did everything for her.I lied to my parents to be able to meet her after school,I bought her chocolates,I fought with my classmates just because they cracked a small joke on her,I was so loyal to her,I gave her all my time,love and attention.I respected her like a father would respect his daughter,I loved her like a son loves his mother and I protected her like a boyfriend protects his girlfriend.After two months,she broke up with me because she as bored and wanted another man.I was really hurt and I still loved her so much.I cried and I suffered everyday because of her but I had to move on.First of all,I had to realise how this girl was.In reality,she was someone who loved for fun and had no sense of moral values whatsoever.I had to put this in my head,then once I did this,I could move on more easily.I said to myself:Is this the type of girl that I deserve?Is she the one worth it?Someone who does not love me back and makes me suffer like I'm a toy.I realised how much of a pain she was,then I proceeded with blocking her and deleting her number so that I may never talk with her.Finally,I continued working hard in school and with great efforts,I could move on.All of these things called love,it just takes place in your head.Once you get control over your head,you will be able to move on.It is just your head,take control of it and moving on shall be easy.If you have any doubts,please feel free to ask me in the form below</h3>

  <p><i>This is another short story by another one of our members</i></p>
  <p><h3>Moving on is quite a difficult step after a heart break or after getting rejected by your crush but remember it ain't impossible.Let me tell you a bit about my love life:Last year,after crushing for months on that special guy in my tuition,we finally ended up going out.Indeed it was the best time of my life but what I didn't know was that this boy was a flirt and not loyal at all.At this time,behind my back,he was flirting with other girls.For him,all this was merely a game.After one month,he told me he wanted to break up because he didn't feel the same and in less than a week after breaking up,he was already with another girl.This killed me totally to a point where I was suicidal and I self harmed myself(cutting wrists).I loved that guy so much that I couldn't move on and it affected me a lot,either physically or emotionally.My grades were going down;I was in deppresion,lost contact with a lot of my friends and I judged myself.I believed that I wasn't good enough for him and that I should have DIED!But,one of my friend knocked some common sense into my brain and made me realise a lot of things.The first thing was that I was wasting my time and energy with someone who would not even think or care about me.Two,that I should get over it because it was just a crush,he wasn't my true love,true love surely comes at at an older age like 20.Three,that I was ruining my life because of a boy like him and that I should focus on my dreams.So to move on,I blocked him and cut all contacts with him and also burned all memories I loved with him,that was phase one.The second thing that I did was cry a lot and wash all my sadness away.I let myself grieve and to cope with the pain.I wrote my feelings in a diary or you can talk to it with someone you trust.The third and last thing that I did was get a grip on myself and focused on stuffs that mattered like my family,studies and friends.I kept myself busy and within some time,I had moved on.Believe me,if she/he left you,thn he/she ain't your true love.But also one very important advice is that you should not take revenge.It's useless;Why waste your time with such a person?Just forgive and live happily,this is the perfect revenge!Just trust me on this.If you want any move on advice,go on and ask in the form below.All your problem are anonymous.Or if you want,you can talk with me personally.This is my personal insta username:@d.harshi.Don't be afraid to ask,we are all here to make your life better.Believe me,you will get over it.You are not alone,we are here for you.</h3></p>

  <p><i>I recently broke up with my boyfriend and I'm not crying at all. I still love him though I'm the one who decided to leave. Is it normal?!</i></p>
  <p><b>Yes Miss what you are experiencing is totally normal since you are the one that left him.You definitely had the courage to do this step.You are in a bit of shock right now that's why you aren't crying or doing stuff like that.So just relax.Like it says,time heals,and I am pretty sure it will.Since you had the courage to break up with him since you deserve better,then you should have the courage to get over him.So like you said,you left him because you think you deserve better,if that guy is not treating you well,there is no way in hell that you should return to him.Just be courageous and move on.YOU CAN DO IT.WE BELIEVE IN YOU!</b></p>

    <p><i>I left him because I realised I deserve better. But I miss him. A lot. And I also love him. Should I return to him?</i></p>

  <p><b>Look try talking with him.Explain clearly about the situation to him.Tell him how you feel etc etc..If you still can't get over him right now,I suggest you give the relationship another chance and see what happens.However if he didn't treat you right,then don't return to him.Move on,it will be hard but YOU CAN DO IT!And also,you are not alone,we are here with you.So if you need any advice please ask us.</b></p>
